For an overview of what Sentry does, take a look at the Sentry workflow.

Sentry is designed to be both simple to get off the ground and powerful to grow into. If you have never used Sentry before, this tutorial helps you get started.

Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1. Sign up for an account
    1. This will
    1. Test children
1. Install your SDK
1. Configure your SDK

<p data-noindex>
  This paragraph will not be indexed because it contains the class <code>data-noindex</code>
</p>

<div data-noindex>
  <p>
    This will also not index as a child of an element with <code>data-noindex</code>
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="release"><code>release</code></h3>

This content will fall under the "release" header

## Install an SDK

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. These are platform specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

Install our Python SDK using pip:

\`\`\`
$ pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk==0.16.2
\`\`\`

<pre data-index>
  <code>$ This will be indexed because it contains \`data-index\`</code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code>$ Pre blocks are indexed by default</code>
</pre>

### Configure the SDK

After you completed setting up a project in Sentry, you’ll be given a value which we call a DSN, or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s actually just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

<ul>
  <li>This is text in an li <p>and this text is a paragraph</p>.
</ul>
`;

  const promise = new Promise<Result>((resolve, reject) => {
    remark()
      .use(html)
      .process(markdown, (err, file) => {
        if (err) reject(err);

        const html = String(file);
        resolve({ html, title, url });
      });
  });

  return promise;
};

export default sampleDocument;
